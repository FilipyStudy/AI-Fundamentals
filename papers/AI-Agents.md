## AI Agents overview:

An AI Agent is a system that can perceive and perform some task in a enviroment with precision and efficiency.
That is, the agent can perform this task using the minimum computer resources possible to understand a environment and make some change in an environment to achieve tha given task.

### Agent perception.

An agent perception is all the history of everything that this agent have perceived.
The choose of the action performed by the agent in a moment depends on all of its sequence of perception received until this moment, but not of unknown perceptions.
In math terms, the behavior of an agent is given by a function that maps every sequence of perceptions especifics for an action.
This inteligents artefacts require computational resources and the environment requires non trivial decision making.

### Behavior Consequences.

Considering the behavior consequences of an agent. When this action sequence causes and satisfactory consequence, this agent have a good performance. This notion of performance is maked by a performance measurement, that analyses the environment states. Considering It, it's better to perform a performance measurement by the changes in the environment than the actions of agents itself.

### What is racionality?

##### There is four factors:

* The performance measurement that defines the sucess criteria.
* The previous knowledge of the agent about the environment.
* The actions that this agent can perform.
* The sequence of perceptions of the agent until now.

Definition of an rational agent:

> *" For each sequence of perceptions possible, an rational agent have to select one action to maximize their performance measurement"*

There is one diference between racionality and omniscience. The rationality wants that the measurement performance reach the waited performance, and the omniscience wait for the real performance. The real performance is impossible, even for humans.

### Continous Machine Learning.

Sometimes the agent colects information to modify one future action to maximize the waited performance. One exemplo of this is the exploration of the environment.

### Autonomous agent.

When the agent performs some task based on the projetist knowledge and not in its perception, whe say that agent is non-autonomous. One rational agent have to be autonomous, the agent have to learn by its perception to compensate the previous partial or incorrect knowledge.
