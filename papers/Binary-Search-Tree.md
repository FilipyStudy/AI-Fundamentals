## Binary Search Tree.
Binary Search Tree are non-linear data structures.
They are represented as a finit set of elements named nodes, represented as circles.
The first node of the binary search tree is named as Root.
A more precisely definition of what's a binary search tree, is that it was a hierarquical representation of a dataset. Where one is submitted by another.
One tree is formed by sub-tree's where each new node is one root node of this sub-tree. Node is the link point of the linking inside a tree, the grade of a node is the quantity of son-nodes where that node have.
One 0 degree node is called a leaf node. Every node has just one ascendent.
In Binary Tree each node can have only the maximum of 2 degree's. Where a degree of a tree is:

x $`\in N, where, ( 0 \leq x \leq 2)`$

But the level of a node is about how many generations he was from the root node. Considering the level of one node root beeing equal to 0.

So, the height of a tree is the distance between the root node and the last descending node.
